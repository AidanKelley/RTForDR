# RTForDR

A web-based script I wrote as a summer student at Washington University in St. Louis that takes DICOM CT and DICTOM RT (Radiation Therapy) files as input then returns a directory of CT-compatible files, where the Radiation Therapy file is overlayed onto the CT, in order to create a file that is possible to share and store in current systems.
